This project is a front-end clone of the Lazarev.Agency website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with enhanced interactivity powered by Swiper.js for sliders and GSAP for smooth, modern animations.

The goal of this clone was to deeply understand how premium design agencies like Lazarev structure their websites, create seamless user experiences, and apply bold, minimalistic UI principles. Every section — from the animated hero banner to the case study-style content — was recreated with close attention to detail.

This project serves as both a learning experience and a demonstration of my skills in translating complex designs into functional, animated web interfaces using vanilla web technologies and animation libraries.
